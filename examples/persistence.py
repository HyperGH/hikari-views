# If you want your components to work and persist after an application restart,
# you have to make them persistent. There are two conditions to this:
# - The view's timeout must explicitly be set to None
# - All components MUST have a unique custom_id
# It is recommended to tie custom_ids to some variable to ensure they do not match,
# to avoid conflicts. (e.g. a UUID stored in a database), but that is outside the
# scope of this example.

# Tip: It is recommended to subclass components to have the ability to pass
# custom_id variables. See the subclassed example on how to do this.

# Tip 2: To check if your view can be persistent or not, use the View.is_persistent
# boolean property.
