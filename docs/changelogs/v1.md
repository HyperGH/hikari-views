# Versions 1.0 - 1.1.2

These are all the changelogs for stable releases of hikari-miru (version 1.0.0 to 1.1.1).

----

## Version 1.1.2

- Updated `hikari` to `v2.0.0.dev110`.
- Added `app_permissions` field to `Interaction`.

## Version 1.1.1

- Remove debug prints from `NavigatorView.send()`

## Version 1.1.0

- Add `miru.unload()` to unload miru and remove the application reference.

- Add `miru.get_view()` to get a currently running view by message snowflakeish.

- Add `ephemeral` kwarg to `NavigatorView` for ephemeral support.

- Annotate `miru.button()` and `miru.select()` to return their respective objects.

- No longer use explicit submodules unless they are exported in context type signatures.

- Allow message objects in `miru.View.start_listener()`.

- Make colorama an optional Windows-only dependency.

- Fix a bug where URL buttons would fail to initialize. ([#17][https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-miru/issues/17])

- Fix a bug where `miru.Context.edit_response()` would not work correctly after initial response.

Thanks to [sadru][https://github.com/thesadru] for help with this release.

## Version 1.0.0

- Remove `app` parameter from `View`.

- Add `miru.load()` to load miru and pass `app`. This replaces passing `app` to view, and should be called once on startup.

- Add `Context` and switch all item methods to use it in favour of `Interaction`.

- Moved all short-hand methods from `Interaction` to `Context`, renaming some of them. Please check the API reference for both.

- `Interaction` is now practically identical to `hikari.ComponentInteraction` with no added methods.

- Added documentation to the project

- Views are now assigned to messages, and if a new view is assigned to a message that already has one, the old one will be automatically stopped. This does not apply to unbound persistent views.
