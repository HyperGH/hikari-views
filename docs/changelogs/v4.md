# Versions 4.0+

These are all the changelogs for stable releases of hikari-miru (version 4.0.0 to present).

## v.4.0.0

<!--TODO Changelog-->
- **BREAKING:** Change all `@miru` decorators to take `Context` as their first argument and the item (button/select etc..) as their second.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `miru.install()`. Use `miru.Client` instead.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `View.start()` and `Modal.start()`. Use `Client.start_view()` and `Client.start_modal()` respectively instead.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `NavigatorView.send()`. Use `NavigatorView.build_response()` instead and send the builder.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `Modal.send()`. Use `Modal.build_response()` instead and send the builder.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `Menu.send()`. Use `Menu.build_response()` instead and send the builder.
- **BREAKING:** Made `ViewItem.callback` only accept positional arguments. This is to allow renaming the context variable's name when overriding it in subclasses. This should not affect most people.
- Added `miru.Client`. The client manages the state of all currently running views & modals & routes interactions to them.
- Added **RESTBot** support. Simply pass a RESTBot to `miru.Client` when initializing it.
