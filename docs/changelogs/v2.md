# Versions 2.0 - 2.0.4

These are all the changelogs for stable releases of hikari-miru (version 2.0.0 to 2.0.4).

----

## Version 2.0.4

- Fixed setter of `TextInput.value` incorrectly rejecting strings of proper length.

## Version 2.0.3

- Add `View.message_id`.
- Make usage of `__all__` consistent across the library.
- Minor documentation fixes.

## Version 2.0.2

- Fix `Context.edit_response()` typehints.
- Fix navigator attachments being kept between page changes.

## Version 2.0.1

- Unblock `View.wait_for_input()` when `View.stop()` is called.

## Version 2.0.0

- BREAKING: `View.start()` is now asynchronous and needs to be awaited.

- BREAKING: `View.start_listener()` has been removed. Use `View.start()` instead.

- Added support for modals via `miru.Modal`.

- Added support for text input fields via `miru.TextInput`.

- Added `RawComponentContext`, `RawModalContext`, `ViewContext`, and `ModalContext` that inherit from `Context`.

- Added `miru.InteractionResponse`, an object representing responses sent out by the application to interactions.

- `Context.respond()` and `Context.edit_response()` now return an `InteractionResponse` object.

- Added `Context.bot` and `Context.author` as aliases for `Context.app` and `Context.user` respectively.

- Added overloads to `Context.defer()` to allow use of different deffered response-types.

- Added `miru.abc.ViewItem` and `miru.abc.ModalItem` that inherit from `miru.abc.Item`.

- Views now expect items of type `ViewItem` and provide `ViewContext`.

- `Button` and `Select` are now subclasses of `ViewItem`.

- Added `miru.abc.ItemHandler`. `View` and `Modal` are subclasses of this object.

- Added `miru.abc.ItemHandler.last_context` to access the last received context & interaction by the item handler.

- `miru.abc.ItemHandler` now implements `Sequence[hikari.api.MessageActionRowBuilder]`, and thus can be treated as a sequence of action rows. This means that calling `.build()` on item handlers is no longer required.

- Removed `miru.Interaction`.

- Added `View.from_message()` classmethod to allow creation of views from message components.

- Added `View.wait_for_input()` to wait for any component interaction relating to the view.

- Added `timeout` parameter to `ItemHandler.wait()`.

- Added `View.get_context()` and `Modal.get_context()` for custom context support.

- Added two new event types `ModalInteractionCreateEvent` and `ComponentInteractionCreateEvent`.

- These listeners include the corresponding raw context with the event object, along with every field from `hikari.InteractionCreateEvent`.

- `ItemHandler.add_item()`, `ItemHandler.remove_item()`, and `ItemHandler.clear_items()` now return the `ItemHandler` object to allow for method chaining.

- Added `responded` kwarg to `NavigatorView` to have the ability to send navigators on acknowledged interactions.

- Added `start_at` kwarg to `NavigatorView` to define what the first page should be.

- Added a "Jump to page" modal to built-in `ext.nav.IndicatorButton` when pressed.

- Allow passing `datetime.timedelta` to `ItemHandler.timeout` upon instantiation.

- Add `delete_after` to `Context.respond()` as a kwarg, and as a method to `InteractionResponse`.

- Added `miru.ext.nav.utils.Paginator` to help pagination of long strings.

- `View.start()` now accepts awaitables that return `hikari.Message`, thus allowing it to function with custom objects that support this behaviour.

- Fixed selectoption `is_default` fields being ignored.

- Deprecate `miru.load` and `miru.unload` in favor of `miru.install` and `miru.uninstall`.
